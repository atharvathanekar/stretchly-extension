Part 1: Modified Product Requirements Document (PRD).
1. Introduction & Problem Statement
Professionals and hobbyists who spend extended hours at a desk... are at high risk for developing chronic physical ailments... Stretchly is a lightweight browser extension that seamlessly integrates into the user's day, providing gentle, timely, and actionable prompts to stretch and move.
2. Goals & Objectives
User Goal: Reduce physical discomfort and improve posture during long screen-time sessions with guidance relevant to my specific pain points.
Product Goal: Become an indispensable daily utility by delivering personalized, tangible health benefits without disrupting workflow.
Business Goal (MVP): Validate the core value proposition and achieve a 4-week user retention rate of 20%.
Business Goal (Post-MVP): Increase 4-week retention to 35% after launching the personalization features.
3. Success Metrics
North Star Metric: Daily Active Users (DAU) who complete or "snooze" at least one prompt.
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
(Unchanged from before) Activation Rate, 4-Week Retention, Prompt Interaction Ratio.
[New Metric for Post-MVP] Questionnaire Completion Rate: % of new users who complete the onboarding questionnaire vs. skip it.
[New Metric for Post-MVP] A/B Test on Retention: Compare the retention of users with a personalized stretch plan vs. those on the generic track.


4. Target Audience
Primary Persona: "The Focused Professional"
Pain Points: Gets lost in "flow state," ends the day with a stiff neck and back.
Needs: A reminder system that is smart enough not to break their concentration but effective enough to prevent physical strain. They would value a solution that understands their specific problem (e.g., "my neck is always the first thing to hurt").

Secondary Persona: "The Marathon Gamer"
Pain Points: Sits for 4-8 hour sessions, experiences wrist/hand fatigue and poor posture.
Needs: Quick, effective movements they can do during a loading screen. They would value tips focused specifically on eye strain and wrist health.


5. MVP Feature Requirements & User Stories
(The MVP feature set remains the same as previously defined: Timed Notifications, Notification Pop-up, Randomized GENERAL Stretches, Basic Sound Settings.)
6. Key User Flows
MVP (v1.0) User Flow
Onboarding Flow:
User installs extension from Chrome Web Store.
A new tab opens with a simple "Welcome to Stretchly!" message.
Message explains the "what" and "how": "We'll nudge you every hour with a simple stretch. Click our icon to adjust settings. Happy stretching!"
The background timer starts automatically with a generic set of stretches.

Core Loop:
Timer completes -> Modal appears with a random general stretch.
User interacts (Start, Snooze, Skip).
Timer resets.

Post-MVP (v1.1) "Personalized" User Flow
New Onboarding Flow:
User installs extension.
A new tab opens with the "Welcome to Stretchly!" message.
A modal appears: "Let's personalize your stretches! Tell us what bothers you most. (This is optional)."
The user is presented with a clean, multi-select list of concerns (e.g., [ ] Neck & Shoulders, [ ] Lower Back, [ ] Eye Strain, [ ] Wrists & Hands, [ ] General Stiffness).
User selects their focus areas and clicks "Save," OR they click a "Skip for now" button.
The background timer starts. The pool of available stretches is now weighted or filtered based on the user's selections. If skipped, it uses the default general pool.

Core Loop (Personalized):
Timer completes -> Modal appears with a random stretch from the user's personalized/filtered pool of tips.
User interacts (Start, Snooze, Skip).
Timer resets.

7. Out of Scope for MVP
Smart Onboarding Questionnaire & Personalized Stretch Tracks.
Customizable timers. (Moved to Fast Follow)
Dark mode, gamification, video/voice guides, calendar integration, team features.

Part 2: Updated Competitive Analysis & Differentiation
The addition of the personalization feature fundamentally strengthens our unique selling proposition.
Competitive Analysis Table 
Updated Differentiators:
The Path to Hyper-Personalization (Our Key Differentiator):
Competitors: Most apps are "one-size-fits-all." Stretchly allows users to write their own tips, but this is high-effort. No competitor actively learns about the user's needs to tailor content out of the box.
Stretchly Differentiator: The Smart Onboarding Questionnaire is our wedge. We will be the only product in this space that asks "Where does it hurt?" and then delivers a solution. This creates an immediate, powerful connection with the user and a high barrier to switching. Our marketing language can shift from "Get stretch reminders" to "Get the right stretches for you, right when you need them."
A Philosophy of "Gentle Guidance":
Our UX remains a core differentiator. It will be calming, beautiful, and respectful of the user's workflow, now enhanced with content that feels more relevant and less random.
Expert-Curated Content, Intelligently Delivered:
We position ourselves as a wellness guide, not just a timer. The questionnaire makes this claim much more tangible. We aren't just giving you a good stretch; we're giving you a good stretch for your sore back. This is a premium experience we can offer for free, building immense user trust and loyalty.



Here is the RICE analysis 
RICE Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
Part 3: Updated Feature Prioritization using RICE
I've added the "Smart Onboarding Questionnaire" to the table. Note its relationship to "Stretch Categories"—the questionnaire is the input, and the categories are the content system that makes it work. They are two sides of the same coin.

Top Fast Follow. This is our first major post-launch feature. It has a massive impact on perceived value and retention but requires significant upfront work (questionnaire UI, content tagging, filtering logic). We'll launch the MVP and immediately start building this.

Future. Still important for showing progress but comes after core functionality is enhanced.

Updated Roadmap Summary:
MVP Launch (v1.0): Features 1-5. A simple, reliable reminder system with a general pool of high-quality stretches. Goal: Validate the core concept.
Fast Follow (v1.1 - The "Personalization" Release): Implement Custom Intervals and the Smart Onboarding Questionnaire with Stretch Categories. Goal: Dramatically increase user engagement and perceived value.
Future Roadmap (v1.2+): Dashboard, Dark Mode, Gamification, etc.
